Abstract


The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the Web.

This document defines a textual syntax for RDF called Turtle that allows an RDF graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and
datatypes. Turtle provides levels of compatibility with the N-Triples [N-TRIPLES] format as well as the triple pattern syntax of the SPARQL W3C Recommendation.
