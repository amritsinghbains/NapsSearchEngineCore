Abstract


This document describes Modality Components in the MMI Architecture which are responsible for controlling the various input and output modalities on various devices by providing guidelines and
suggestions for designing Modality Components. Also this document shows several possible examples of Modality Components, (1) face identification, (2) form-filling using handwriting recognition and
(3) video display.

This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this

This is the 1 March 2011 W3C Working Group Note of "Best practices for creating MMI Modality Components". The Multimodal Interaction Working Group once published a Working Draft of the "Multimodal
Architecture and Interfaces (MMI Architecture)" on 16 October 2008 with this content. However, the Working Group concluded that the description on how to create Modality Components and examples of
possible Modality Components should be published as a Working Group Note rather than part of the MMI Architecture specification. The goal of this Working Group Note is to provide guidelines and
suggestions for designing Modality Components in the MMI Architecture and make it easier to author concrete Modality Components for multimodal Web applications. Also this document shows several
possible examples of Modality Components, (1) face identification, (2) form-filling using handwriting recognition and (3) video display.
