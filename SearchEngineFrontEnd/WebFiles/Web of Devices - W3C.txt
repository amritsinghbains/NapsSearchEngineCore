W3C is focusing on technologies to enable Web access anywhere, anytime, using any device. This includes Web access from mobile phones and other mobile devices as well as use of Web technology in
consumer electronics, printers, interactive television, and even automobiles.










W3C promotes &#x201C;One Web&#x201D; that is available on any device. W3C&#x2019;s Mobile Web Initiative helps ensure the best user experience on mobile devices, taking into account device
capabilities, location, and other context information.







The W3C Speech Interface Framework is a suite of specifications (e.g. VoiceXML) integrating Web technology and speech interaction. VoiceXML, PLS, SISR, SRGS, SCXML, and CCXML all contribute to the
Speech Interface Framework.







Devices come in many shapes, capabilities and sizes which define constraints on the content these devices can handle. Device descriptions, content transformation guidelines, device APIs and CC/PP
help developers to optimize the user experience.









Increasingly, interactions with devices doesn&#x2019;t only happen with a keyboard, but also through voice, touch and gestures. The W3C Multimodal architecture and its components (EMMA, InkML) allow
developers to adapt applications to new interaction modes.







With the advent of IP-based devices, connected TVs are progressing at a fast pace and traditional TV broadcasting is quickly evolving into a more immersive experience where users can interact with
rich applications that are at least partly based on Web technologies. There is strong growth in the deployment of devices that integrate regular Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and SVG, coupled
with various device APIs.
