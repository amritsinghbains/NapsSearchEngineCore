Abstract


Task models are useful when designing and developing interactive systems. They describe the logical activities that have to be carried out in order to reach the user’s goals. This document covers
the specification of Task Models, with a meta-model expressed in UML, and an XML Schema that can be used as the basis for interchange of Task Models between different user interface development
tools.


Status of This Document

technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.

This document defines a meta-model and XML serialization for task models for describing user interfaces. This is an update to the First Public Working Draft to conform to the policy for W3C
namespace URIs, and to make minor changes to terminology.

This document has been published as a Working Group Note to reflect the fact that the Model Based UI Working Group is no longer progressing it along the W3C Recommendation Track. A record of

Publication as a Working Group Note does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is
inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress.
