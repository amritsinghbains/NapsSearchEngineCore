Abstract


The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is not scaling to meet the requirements of today's dynamic, interactive webs. For this reason, multiple vendors have proposed C callable APIs. These APIs allow
authors to alleviate the performance penalty of CGI, and allow tighter integration of add-in modules. Unfortunately, this comes at the price of complexity and portability.

This document describes a new model for extending WWW servers. First, HTTP is captured using an interface specification, which eliminates the ambiguities of interpretating a standards-track
document. This interface is then implemented atop a particular httpd's API. Finally, all of this is done using a standard distributed object model called ILU.

Digital Creations' work on our ILU Requester reflects this design and shows its advantages. This paper describes the ILU Requester.
